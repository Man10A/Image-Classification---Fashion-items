# Image-Classification---Fashion-items
Dataset: Fashion MNIST. The dataset includes tiny images of fashion pieces. The objective is to create a set of supervised learning models that can predict the type of item based on its image.

Tools Used: Python, ML (Pandas, Numpy, tensor Flow) 

Classified type of item from images of 60,000 fashion images belonging to 10 different categories, including shoe images, shirt images, bag images, etc. The optimal model was applied to newly taken images from the phone as part of the test, and the images were correctly identified with 80% accuracy.

If you would like a better explanation or solution method, please refer to the ".ipynb" file.

Also, I uploaded the pictures I took with my phone, using predictions to determine

I am sure the results can be improved and i am working on it. Thank you.
